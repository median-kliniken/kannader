# smtp-server & smtp-message

A fork of [Kannader](https://github.com/Ekleog/kannader), reduced to only the
SMTP server and message type crates. 

Kannader is an SMTP server designed from the ground up with the intention of
being both highly configurable and secure-by-default.

This crate is part of the ecosystem of crates developed to support it. It is
still possible to use it for other use cases, but the one it was designed for is
kannader.
